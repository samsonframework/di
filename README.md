##Main features:
 * The fastest possible dependency injection container implementation.
 * ```25/01/2016``` DOES NOT(yet) support setter injections.
 * ```25/01/2016``` DOES NOT(yet) support existing instances as dependencies.
 * Supports regular constructor parameters combined with type hinted dependencies.
 * Supports closures as dependencies.
 * Supports services - singleton object instance that needs to be created only once.
 * Implements [container-interop](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop)(PSR-11).
 * Implements [container-interop delegate lookup feature](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop/blob/master/docs/Delegate-lookup.md).
 
##Auto-wiring
We do not support these feature as we suppose that your software using this awesome package should declare
which entities need resolving using ```set()``` method. But feel free to create a ```AutoWireContainer``` that
will get all declared classes, find ones created by user and call ```set()``` for them.

>I really do not think that you need to auto-wire all existing classes.
 
###Why we are the fastest
This implementation is lacking all other needed and awesome features like injectors and configurations(for now), but
this is fastest possible dependency injection implementation. The core of its performance is generated PHP code. We perform
static analysis of defined entities and their dependencies and generate PHP code logic function. Here is an example:
```php
function diContainer($aliasOrClassName)
{
    static $services;
    
    if ($aliasOrClassName === '\samsonframework\di\tests\OtherTestClass') {
        return 
        new \samsonframework\di\tests\OtherTestClass(
            new \samsonframework\di\tests\OtherThirdTestClass(
                new \samsonframework\di\tests\OtherSecondTestClass()
            ),
            array(
                '0' => '0',
                '1' => '1',
                '2' => '2',
                '3' => '3',
            ),
            'I am string2'
        );
    } elseif ($aliasOrClassName === '\samsonframework\di\tests\OtherThirdTestClass') {
        return 
        new \samsonframework\di\tests\OtherThirdTestClass(
            new \samsonframework\di\tests\OtherSecondTestClass()
        );
    } elseif ($aliasOrClassName === '\samsonframework\di\tests\TestModuleClass') {
        return 
        new \samsonframework\di\tests\TestModuleClass(
            new \samsonframework\di\tests\OtherTestClass(
                new \samsonframework\di\tests\OtherThirdTestClass(
                    new \samsonframework\di\tests\OtherSecondTestClass()
                ),
                array(
                    '0' => '0',
                    '1' => '1',
                    '2' => '2',
                    '3' => '3',
                ),
                'I am string2'
            ),
            new \samsonframework\di\tests\OtherSecondTestClass(),
            array(
                '0' => '1',
                '1' => '2',
                '2' => '3',
            ),
            'I am string'
        );
    } elseif ($aliasOrClassName === '\samsonframework\di\tests\TestServiceClass') {
        return 
        isset($services['\samsonframework\di\tests\TestServiceClass'])
        ? $services['\samsonframework\di\tests\TestServiceClass']
        : $services['\samsonframework\di\tests\TestServiceClass'] = new \samsonframework\di\tests\TestServiceClass(
            new \samsonframework\di\tests\TestModuleClass(
                new \samsonframework\di\tests\OtherTestClass(
                    new \samsonframework\di\tests\OtherThirdTestClass(
                        new \samsonframework\di\tests\OtherSecondTestClass()
                    ),
                    array(
                        '0' => '0',
                        '1' => '1',
                        '2' => '2',
                        '3' => '3',
                    ),
                    'I am string2'
                ),
                new \samsonframework\di\tests\OtherSecondTestClass(),
                array(
                    '0' => '1',
                    '1' => '2',
                    '2' => '3',
                ),
                'I am string'
            ),
            array(
                '0' => '1',
                '1' => '2',
                '2' => '3',
            ),
            'I am string'
        );
    } elseif ($aliasOrClassName === 'callbackTest') {
        return new \samsonframework\di\tests\OtherTestClass(
        new \samsonframework\di\tests\OtherThirdTestClass(
        new \samsonframework\di\tests\OtherSecondTestClass()
        ),
        array('1'),
        '1'
        );
    }
}
```

##Extending package
This container can be easily extended using [container-interop delegate lookup feature](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop/blob/master/docs/Delegate-lookup.md).
So you can implement container-interop ```ContainerInterface``` and pass it to ```$container->delegate($yourContainer)```, this approach was used for
creating Closure implementation(```ClosureContainer```).

##Closure implementation
The idea behind closure implementation is that you create all dependencies manually there so we simply parse
your closure code and just insert it "as it is" into logic function by its alias(see last if branch in example).
> We do not support parameters as this callback are ment not to have them
Also we are not supporting ```use``` closure syntax as it should be using context from a file that declares closure.

##Installation
You can install this package through Composer:
```composer require samsonframework/di```

The packages adheres to the SemVer specification, and there will be full backward compatibility between minor versions.

##Testing
```$ vendor/bin/phpunit```
